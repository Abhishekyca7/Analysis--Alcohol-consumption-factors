# Analysis--Alcohol-consumption-factors
# Project description

You will create logistic and Poisson regression models to understand factors that relate to alcohol consumption.  
<br>
The dataset you will use is from the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey from 2013. The data was collected from adults (18 years +) living in the United States. The data was collected via telephone survey, using disproportionate stratified sampling (to yield better estimates than simple random sampling) for the landline sample, and using randomly selected respondents for the cellular phone sample. (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/)  
<br>
The purpose of the survey is to collect data about health-related risk behaviours (food, sleep, alcohol, smoking), medical/health conditions, and the use of medical services. 
<br>
All data collected is observational, so we will not be able to determine causal relationships. However, a better understanding of the associations can help identify potential risk factors or variables to target for intervention.
